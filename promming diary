Given the problem statement.
"In order to reduce user intervention for net banking fetch, need to automate the extra validation present in website like captcha. 
Some website provide 2 option for this kind of validation one is captcha as audio and other as image. 
We need to automated both option in order to reduce manually entering of such data from user end".

* Revised all python basics such as datatypes ,lists,tuples,functions,conditional statements,file handling,exception handling.
import csv
print("hello")
fo=open("abc.txt","r")
s=fo.read(100)
# fo.write("This is the first line")
print(s)
fo.close()

with open('/home/muppuri/Downloads/S&P500_Stock_Data (1).csv','r') as f:
    readCsv = csv.reader(f,delimiter=",")
    stock= list(readCsv)
print(stock[0])
selected=[]
for row in stock[1:6]:
    selected.append(row)
print(selected)

#read binary file
import pickle
with open("file.dat","rb") as f:
    while True:
        try:
            row=pickle.load(f)
            print(row)
        except EOFError:
            break
#copy one file contents to another file (binary)
import pickle 
f1=open("data.dat","rb")
f2=open("new.dat","wb")
while True:
    try:
        row=pickle.load(f1)
        pickle.dump(row,f2)
    except EOFError:
        break
f1.close()
f2.close()

#update any row if any condition satisified
with open("employee.dat",'rb+') as f:
    while True:
        try:
            record_pos=f.tell
            row=pickle.load(f)
            if(row[0] == 'E002'):
                row[2] = 50000
                f.seek(record_pos,0)
                pickle.dump(row,f)
        except EOFError:
            break
            
#write binary file
import pickle
with open("file.dat","wb") as f:
    while True:
        op=int(input("enter 1 to add data, 0 to quit"))
        if op==1:
            name=input("Endter name")
            rollno=int(input("Enter roll number"))
            pickle.dump((name,rollno),f)
        elif op==0:
            break
